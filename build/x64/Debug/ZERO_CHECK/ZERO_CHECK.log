  1>Checking Build System
  CMake is re-running because D:/GitHub/FastPlanner/build/trajopt_bspline/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
    the file 'D:/GitHub/FastPlanner/trajopt_bspline/CMakeLists.txt'
    is newer than 'D:/GitHub/FastPlanner/build/trajopt_bspline/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'
    result='-1'
  CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
    CMake.
  
    Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
    to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
    to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
